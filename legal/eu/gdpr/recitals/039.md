## Overview
Recital 39 elaborates on the principle of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency in data processing.

## Key Points

### Lawfulness and Fairness
Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed.

### Transparency Principle
The principle of transparency requires that any information and communication relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language be used.

### Application
This principle concerns, in particular:
- Information to data subjects about the identity of the controller
- Information about the purposes of processing
- Further information to ensure fair and transparent processing

### Personal Data Awareness
Natural persons should be made aware of:
- Risks associated with processing
- Rules designed to mitigate risks
- Safeguards in place
- Their rights regarding processing
- How to exercise those rights
